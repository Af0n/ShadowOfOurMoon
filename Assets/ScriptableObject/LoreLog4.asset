  log: "From: Mission Control Command (MCC)\r\nTo: Lunar Base Command\r\nSubject:
    URGENT: Moon\u2019s Orbit Suspended \u2013 Immediate Action Required\r\n\r\nEmail
    from Mission Control Command\r\nDate: 2024-11-11\r\nTime: 09:45 AM\r\nLunar Base
    Command,\r\nWe\u2019re experiencing an unprecedented situation, and frankly,
    we\u2019re at a loss. Approximately one hour ago, all tracking systems confirmed
    that the Moon is no longer in its natural orbit around Earth. Somehow, it appears
    suspended in place, trapped in Earth\u2019s shadow, and it hasn\u2019t moved
    since the last seismic event on the lunar surface. As of now, there\u2019s no
    evidence of any natural phenomenon that could explain this, and we\u2019re grasping
    for theories on how this is even possible.\r\nThe Earth is in turmoil\u2014massive
    public panic, news reports worldwide speculating everything from extraterrestrial
    activity to gravitational anomalies. We\u2019re already seeing infrastructure
    disruptions, and we expect this to escalate quickly if the Moon remains fixed.
    Ground-based observatories have no explanation, and we can\u2019t reach any of
    the facilities on the Moon\u2019s dark side. As of this moment, all dark-side
    research bases have gone offline en masse.\r\nGiven the unknown cause and to
    facilitate investigation, we\u2019re issuing a priority directive: begin immediate
    construction of \u201CLighthouse\u201D structures at all bases currently located
    in the shadow zone. These Lighthouses are to be equipped with high-intensity
    beacons and transmitters aimed at enabling triangulation, communication, and
    visibility in these darkened areas. The Lighthouses will also serve as signal
    beacons for any units on the far side to help us re-establish communications
    if they regain power or systems control.\r\nWe don\u2019t know if this shadow
    state will last, but prepare for a sustained effort to keep the light and communication
    lines open. We\u2019re sending every available resource to help stabilize the
    situation from here, but we\u2019re counting on all lunar bases to act swiftly
    to manage local operations and continue to report back on any signs of movement,
    anomalous energy readings, or environmental changes.\r\nPlease keep us updated
    on every development. Right now, we need all hands on deck to make sense of this
    situation. And remember, we\u2019re with you.\r\n\u2014 Mission Control"
