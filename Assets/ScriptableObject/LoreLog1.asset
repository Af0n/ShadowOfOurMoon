  log: "Telescope Facility Status Log\r\nDate: xxxxxx\r\nOperator: J. Doe\r\nFacility:
    Lunar Far Side Observatory (LFSO)\r\n\r\n[00:00] Status: All systems operational.
    Telescope array initialized in standby mode on lunar far side. Remote uplink
    confirmed.\r\n[00:05] Observation Start: Observation sequence initiated. Target:
    Messier 87 Galaxy. Remote guidance and tracking active.\r\n[00:15] Lunar Conditions
    Report: Lunar surface stable. No seismic activity detected. Solar wind levels
    minimal.\r\n[00:30] Observation Progress: Telescope successfully locked on target.
    Data collection ongoing. All systems stable.\r\n[01:00] Observation Checkpoint:
    50% of data collection completed. Signal-to-noise ratio nominal. No interference
    detected.\r\n[01:45] Warning 9800: Vibration sensors detect abnormal tremors
    at telescope base. Severity Level: Low. Monitoring.\r\n[01:55] Alert: Sudden
    impact detected near telescope structure. Severity Level: Critical. Automated
    systems securing data.\r\n[02:00] Error 9001: Telescope hardware integrity compromised.
    Structural sensors offline. Emergency shutdown initiated.\r\n[02:02] Catastrophic
    Error 0000: Telescope failure confirmed. Severe structural damage detected, likely
    caused by meteoroid impact. Data uplink unstable.\r\n[02:05] Final Status Update:
    Last transmission confirms extensive damage. Telescope systems non-operational.
    Mission control notified.\r\n[02:10] Data Link Lost: Connection with Lunar Far
    Side Observatory severed. All communication attempts unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nSummary:
    Observation sequence initiated successfully but terminated following a severe
    impact event. All telemetry data suggests telescope destruction, likely by meteoroid
    impact. Final data secured before signal loss. Awaiting further assessment for
    possible recovery mission.\r\nEmail from Dr. \u2014---\r\nDate: xxxxx\r\nTime:
    xxxxx\r\nHi \u2014---,\r\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the alert by now. Our
    telescope on the far side went down just a few hours ago, and unfortunately,
    this looks serious. The last log entries confirm an impact at 01:55\u2014sensors
    caught a direct hit on the primary structure. Initial diagnostics show catastrophic
    damage, and we lost the uplink minutes later. It doesn\u2019t look recoverable
    remotely, and all systems are offline.\r\nI\u2019m trying to retrieve as much
    pre-failure data as possible, but without a live link, we\u2019re limited to
    what we managed to cache before the connection dropped. I\u2019ll send over everything
    I have shortly, though I doubt it includes anything from the final observation
    sequence.\r\nDo you have any ideas? I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s at least a chance
    we can salvage part of it or determine a more precise cause. The data suggests
    a meteoroid impact, but I\u2019d feel more comfortable if we could confirm.\r\nLet
    me know your thoughts.\r\nBest,\r\n\u2014---"
