  log: "Private Log \u2013 Dr. Emily Zhao\nDate: 2024-11-12\nTime: 02:30 AM\n\nI\u2019ve
    never felt anything like this\u2014anxious, confused, almost\u2026 haunted. I
    can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m writing that, but things feel wrong here, so
    I need to get this down, even if it\u2019s just to convince myself I\u2019m not
    losing it.\nThe Moon has been trapped in Earth\u2019s shadow for over 24 hours
    now. The landscape is completely different, utterly alien. Our floodlights can
    only do so much, and even with the new Lighthouse structures we set up, everything
    is still cast in a strange, dim twilight. I used to know every rock and ridge
    around here by heart, but now\u2026 now they all look distorted, looming larger
    than they should. There\u2019s something about the way the shadows stretch and
    move that makes everything feel wrong. The Moon\u2019s surface, usually so clear
    and sharp, looks like it\u2019s wavering just at the edges, like something is
    shifting out there just beyond the lights.\nMaybe it\u2019s just my nerves. Maybe
    the darkness is playing tricks on me. But earlier, I felt like I was being watched.
    It sounds ridiculous, but when I was alone outside running some quick checks
    on the equipment, I swear I felt eyes on me\u2014just a weight of something watching
    from the darkness. I kept turning around, and there was nothing there, only those
    strange, flickering shadows. But they felt\u2026 alive, almost like they were
    pulling closer, just past the reach of the lights.\nI\u2019m not the only one
    feeling it, either. I heard Davis whispering to himself earlier, muttering about
    the shadows \u201Ccrawling.\u201D He laughed it off when I asked, but his eyes
    looked wide and unsettled. We\u2019ve all been in low-light conditions plenty,
    but nothing has ever felt like this. The shadows around the Lighthouse beams
    seem to move, almost flowing like liquid, stretching and shifting with an unsettling
    rhythm that doesn\u2019t match any movement I\u2019d expect from lights alone.\nIt\u2019s
    irrational, I know. There\u2019s no atmosphere here, no wind, no reason for anything
    to move at all. But here I am, staring out at the darkness, feeling like it\u2019s
    staring back at m"
