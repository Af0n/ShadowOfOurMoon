  log: "From: Dr. Elias Porter, Lunar Biologist\r\nTo: Dr. Jana Torres, Lunar Science
    Lead\r\nSubject: Discovery of Unknown Lunar \u201CSapling\u201D - Sample Collected\r\n\r\nEmail
    from Dr. Elias Porter\r\nDate: 2024-11-11\r\nTime: 07:15 AM\r\nJana,\r\nI can
    hardly believe what we found\u2014I'm writing this right from the rover because
    I didn\u2019t want to wait to get back to Boundary Station to tell you.\r\nDuring
    our post-quake inspection, about 500 meters from the epicenter of last night\u2019s
    seismic event, we encountered something completely unexpected. We were combing
    through the affected area when we spotted a small, upright structure pushing
    out of the regolith. At first, I thought it was some type of debris or rock formation,
    but on closer inspection, it looked\u2026 alive. It\u2019s the size of a small
    sapling, maybe 20 cm high, with a thin stem and several oddly branching structures
    that look almost like primitive leaves. The color is faintly greenish, too\u2014nothing
    we\u2019ve ever seen here before.\r\nI collected the \u201Csapling\u201D (I don\u2019t
    know what else to call it!) for immediate study, using full sterile procedures.
    I know it sounds impossible, but there\u2019s no doubt: it has an organic structure.
    It seems intact despite the seismic disruption around it, which in itself is
    bizarre. You know as well as I do how unlikely it is for anything organic to
    appear spontaneously on the lunar surface\u2014let alone survive the extreme
    conditions, radiation, and the quake itself.\r\nHonestly, I\u2019m excited but
    also slightly unsettled. If the quake exposed this thing, where did it come from?
    Could it have emerged from beneath the surface during the quake? There was some
    soil displacement from the tremors, which might explain why we\u2019ve never
    seen anything like this before. I\u2019ll secure the sample in the station\u2019s
    quarantine chamber once we\u2019re back and run a full analysis.\r\nWe need to
    have a deeper look at the soil layers around the quake site. I\u2019ll update
    you with lab results as soon as possible, but I think we might be onto something
    unprecedented here.\r\nBest,\r\nElias"
