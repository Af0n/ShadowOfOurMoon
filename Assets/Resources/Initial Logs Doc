Hi —---,
I’m sure you’ve seen the alert by now. Our telescope on the far side went down just a few hours ago, and unfortunately, this looks serious. The last log entries confirm an impact at 01:55—sensors caught a direct hit on the primary structure. Initial diagnostics show catastrophic damage, and we lost the uplink minutes later. It doesn’t look recoverable remotely, and all systems are offline.
I’m trying to retrieve as much pre-failure data as possible, but without a live link, we’re limited to what we managed to cache before the connection dropped. I’ll send over everything I have shortly, though I doubt it includes anything from the final observation sequence.
Do you have any ideas? I’m hoping there’s at least a chance we can salvage part of it or determine a more precise cause. The data suggests a meteoroid impact, but I’d feel more comfortable if we could confirm.
Let me know your thoughts.
Best,

Jana,
I can hardly believe what we found—I'm writing this right from the rover because I didn’t want to wait to get back to Boundary Station to tell you.
During our post-quake inspection, about 500 meters from the epicenter of last night’s seismic event, we encountered something completely unexpected. We were combing through the affected area when we spotted a small, upright structure pushing out of the regolith. At first, I thought it was some type of debris or rock formation, but on closer inspection, it looked… alive. It’s the size of a small sapling, maybe 20 cm high, with a thin stem and several oddly branching structures that look almost like primitive leaves. The color is faintly greenish, too—nothing we’ve ever seen here before.
I collected the “sapling” (I don’t know what else to call it!) for immediate study, using full sterile procedures. I know it sounds impossible, but there’s no doubt: it has an organic structure. It seems intact despite the seismic disruption around it, which in itself is bizarre. You know as well as I do how unlikely it is for anything organic to appear spontaneously on the lunar surface—let alone survive the extreme conditions, radiation, and the quake itself.
Honestly, I’m excited but also slightly unsettled. If the quake exposed this thing, where did it come from? Could it have emerged from beneath the surface during the quake? There was some soil displacement from the tremors, which might explain why we’ve never seen anything like this before. I’ll secure the sample in the station’s quarantine chamber once we’re back and run a full analysis.
We need to have a deeper look at the soil layers around the quake site. I’ll update you with lab results as soon as possible, but I think we might be onto something unprecedented here.
Best,
Elias

Lunar Base Command,
We’re experiencing an unprecedented situation, and frankly, we’re at a loss. Approximately one hour ago, all tracking systems confirmed that the Moon is no longer in its natural orbit around Earth. Somehow, it appears suspended in place, trapped in Earth’s shadow, and it hasn’t moved since the last seismic event on the lunar surface. As of now, there’s no evidence of any natural phenomenon that could explain this, and we’re grasping for theories on how this is even possible.
The Earth is in turmoil—massive public panic, news reports worldwide speculating everything from extraterrestrial activity to gravitational anomalies. We’re already seeing infrastructure disruptions, and we expect this to escalate quickly if the Moon remains fixed. Ground-based observatories have no explanation, and we can’t reach any of the facilities on the Moon’s dark side. As of this moment, all dark-side research bases have gone offline en masse.
Given the unknown cause and to facilitate investigation, we’re issuing a priority directive: begin immediate construction of “Lighthouse” structures at all bases currently located in the shadow zone. These Lighthouses are to be equipped with high-intensity beacons and transmitters aimed at enabling triangulation, communication, and visibility in these darkened areas. The Lighthouses will also serve as signal beacons for any units on the far side to help us re-establish communications if they regain power or systems control.
We don’t know if this shadow state will last, but prepare for a sustained effort to keep the light and communication lines open. We’re sending every available resource to help stabilize the situation from here, but we’re counting on all lunar bases to act swiftly to manage local operations and continue to report back on any signs of movement, anomalous energy readings, or environmental changes.
Please keep us updated on every development. Right now, we need all hands on deck to make sense of this situation. And remember, we’re with you.

Private Log – Dr. Emily Zhao

I’ve never felt anything like this—anxious, confused, almost… haunted. I can’t even believe I’m writing that, but things feel wrong here, so I need to get this down, even if it’s just to convince myself I’m not losing it.
The Moon has been trapped in Earth’s shadow for over 24 hours now. The landscape is completely different, utterly alien. Our floodlights can only do so much, and even with the new Lighthouse structures we set up, everything is still cast in a strange, dim twilight. I used to know every rock and ridge around here by heart, but now… now they all look distorted, looming larger than they should. There’s something about the way the shadows stretch and move that makes everything feel wrong. The Moon’s surface, usually so clear and sharp, looks like it’s wavering just at the edges, like something is shifting out there just beyond the lights.
Maybe it’s just my nerves. Maybe the darkness is playing tricks on me. But earlier, I felt like I was being watched. It sounds ridiculous, but when I was alone outside running some quick checks on the equipment, I swear I felt eyes on me—just a weight of something watching from the darkness. I kept turning around, and there was nothing there, only those strange, flickering shadows. But they felt… alive, almost like they were pulling closer, just past the reach of the lights.
I’m not the only one feeling it, either. I heard Davis whispering to himself earlier, muttering about the shadows “crawling.” He laughed it off when I asked, but his eyes looked wide and unsettled. We’ve all been in low-light conditions plenty, but nothing has ever felt like this. The shadows around the Lighthouse beams seem to move, almost flowing like liquid, stretching and shifting with an unsettling rhythm that doesn’t match any movement I’d expect from lights alone.
It’s irrational, I know. There’s no atmosphere here, no wind, no reason for anything to move at all. But here I am, staring out at the darkness, feeling like it’s staring back at me

Initial Observation Notes – Lunar “Sapling” Specimen
Collected by: Dr. Elias Porter
Date: 2024-11-11
Location: South Pole Region, near seismic event epicenter

Specimen Description:
The “sapling” discovered is unlike any organic structure known on Earth. Standing approximately 20 cm tall, it has a distinct branching structure similar to a young tree, but with an unusual, almost crystalline texture to its surface. The entire specimen is a deep, matte black, absorbing nearly all ambient light.
Key Observations:
Organic Composition: Despite its strange, otherworldly appearance, preliminary scans confirm the sapling is organic. However, its cellular structure is completely alien, unlike any terrestrial plant or fungal cell observed to date.
Light Absorption and Emission: The specimen absorbs nearly all light that touches it, resulting in an unusually dark profile even under direct illumination. Fascinatingly, when physically disturbed, the sapling releases stored light in a faint, steady glow—a phenomenon I’ve never seen in any Earth organism. This glow slowly fades until disturbed again, almost like it “breathes” light when touched.
Retrieval Site Conditions:
The area surrounding the sapling was distinctly disturbed, with large cracks radiating outward across the lunar soil. The ground was unsettled, showing signs of upheaval as if something had pushed through from beneath. The cracks were roughly aligned with the center of last night’s seismic activity, suggesting a potential connection between the sapling's emergence and the quake.
Hypotheses and Initial Questions:
Seismic Link: Could the recent quake have unearthed this sapling, or is it possible the sapling itself played a role in the quake’s intensity?
Adaptations and Origin: The sapling’s light-absorbing and light-releasing properties raise questions about its survival mechanisms. Is it adapted to lunar darkness in some way, or could it be extraterrestrial in origin?
Further analysis will be critical in understanding the biological function and origin of this organism. For now, I am securing it in the isolation chamber for containment and study.
